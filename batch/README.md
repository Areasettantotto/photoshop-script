# Photoshop Batch Scripts

This folder contains a collection of Photoshop `.jsx` scripts
designed to automate repetitive image tasks.

## 📂 Contents

- **`rename-webp.jsx`**
  Renames and copies `.webp` files using a base name + sequential number.
  ➡️ Useful for creating image sets with SEO-friendly filenames.

- **`resize-export-multiple.jsx`**
  Resizes images to **multiple predefined sizes** (1000 → 100 px, 100px steps).
  Exports each version as **JPG** and **PNG-24**.
  ➡️ Useful for preparing responsive images or web galleries.

- **`resize-export-1000px.jsx`**
  Resizes images to a **maximum width of 1000px** (keeps aspect ratio, no upscaling).
  Exports to **JPG** and **PNG-24**.
  ➡️ Useful for getting standardized versions without multiplying formats.

## 🚀 Usage

1. Open **Adobe Photoshop**
2. Go to `File > Scripts > Browse...`
3. Select the desired `.jsx` script from the `batch/` folder
4. Follow the dialogs to:
   - Select the **input folder**
   - Select the **output folder**
   - Wait for the automatic processing

## 📝 Notes

- The scripts do not overwrite original files: they operate on copies saved to the output folder.
- JPG quality is set to **80** (good quality/size trade-off).
- PNG exports use **PNG-24** (maximum quality).
- All scripts avoid **upscaling**: if an image is smaller than the target width, it will not be enlarged.
