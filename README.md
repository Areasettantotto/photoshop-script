# Photoshop Automation Scripts

This repository is dedicated to **Adobe Photoshop users** who want to simplify and speed up their workflow.
Inside you'll find a collection of **automation scripts in `.jsx` format**, ready to use and easy to adapt to your needs.

The scripts are organized into sections based on the type of operations they automate:

- **Batch** → scripts for processing groups of images (renaming, resizing, exporting to various formats, etc.)
- *(additional sections may be added in the future, e.g. “Color Correction”, “Export Helpers”, “Utilities”)*

## 🚀 How to use the scripts
1. Open **Adobe Photoshop**
2. Go to `File > Scripts > Browse...`
3. Select the desired `.jsx` script from the appropriate folder
4. Follow the on-screen prompts (choose folders, parameters, etc.)

## 📝 General notes
- The scripts are designed to be **simple and straightforward**.
- Original files are **never modified**: processed versions are saved to a chosen output folder.
- The code is commented to ease customization.
- The repository will grow over time with new sections and scripts.
